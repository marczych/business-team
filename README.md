Tonight we're gonna do business
You know how I know?
Cause it's a weekday.
Cause on weekdays we do bi'ness

Weekends are the days we stay home and snort cocaine
But weekdays are the days we do bi'ness

Cause everything is just right
Conditions are perfect
Hangover is fading
Conditions are perfect

You lean into my cubicle and say something sexy like
"I've got a case of the Mondays".
I know what you're trying to say, baby,
It's bi'ness time

IT'S BUSINESS
IT'S BUSINESS TEAM

That's what you're trying to say
You're trying to say it's time for business
It's business time ooh

IT'S BUSINESS
IT'S BUSINESS TEAM

Next thing you know we're in the staff room making our coffee
That's all part of it, the team building exercise
Then you sort out the recycling
That's not a part of the team building process but it's still very important

Then we're in the board room
You're wearing that really tacky clip on tie that isn't quite long enough
And it's never looked better on you
Mhhmmmm, board room meetings 9 to 5 oooh
You don't know what you're doing to me

I open my briefcase very, very clumsily,
fumbling sensuously with my TPS reports
Now I'm prepared, except for this new format.
And you know when there's a new format what time it is

IT'S BUSINESS
IT'S BUSINESS TIME

You know when we're discussing stocks it's time for business
That's why they call it business stocks

IT'S BUSINESS
IT'S BUSINESS TIME

Ooh. Making money
Making money for two minutes.
When it's with me girl you only need two minutes,
Because I'm so efficient
You say something like "Is that it?"
I know hwat you're trying to say,
"Aww, yeah, that's it."
Then you tell me you want some more.
Well I'm not surprised.
But it's Friday at 5

IT'S BUSINESS
IT'S BUSINESS TIME

Business hours are over, baby

IT'S BUSINESS
IT'S BUSINESS TIME
